# ü§ñ CovidStats (Discord bot)
CovidStats is a Discord bot built with Discord.js, that provides with basic worldwide COVID statistics

## Requirements
- NodeJS (developed with v12.17.0)
- Discord bot token (added to the channel of your liking)

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/Ryubal/CovidStats`
2. Rename the `config.txt` file to `config.json`
3. Open the `config.json` file with your preferred editor, and set your Discord Bot `token`
4. Install dependencies `npm install`
4. üöÄ Run! `node index.js`

## Usage
The main idea of this bot is to get basic COVID statistics pretty quickly, about a particular country. Below is a description of available commands.

`!covid all`
> Returns all COVID statistics.

> üö® Disabled for now! We need to figure out how to condense +30 countries.

`!covid countries`
> Returns a list of available countries

`!covid [COUNTRY]`
> Returns COVID statistics about **country**. Example: `!covid united states`

`!help [COMMAND]`
> If no **command** provided, will return a list of available commands

> If **command** is provided, will return information about that specific command

`!lang [LANG]`
> If no **lang** provided, will return a list of available languages

> If **lang** is provided, will switch language. Example: `!lang es`

> NOTE: When switching languages, commands will also change to that specific language. If you speak spanish, you can find more information in the `README-ES.md` file.

`!version`
> Will return current bot version

`!ping`
> Will ping the bot

`!author`
> Will return author information (link to this repo)

## Configuring
All settings can be changed by editing the `config.json` file. As of now, only 4 settings can be changed:
- `prefix` - This must be present before a command, in order to be recognized by the bot.
- `token` - Discord bot token
- `defaultLang` - Default language for the bot. Options available: `en`, `es`
- `langs` - Array with languages installed. Files can be located on `./locales`

## Details
This project was created using NodeJS (with the Discord.js library). COVID information is gathered from [Apify](https://apify.com/covid-19) using axios. Translation was integrated with i18n-node.

## Future plans
This bot is in its early stages. Right now it's stable, but very simple. Below are some of the features that I'd like to add in the very next weeks:
- More useful COVID-related commands. Stats, graphs, health information, etc.
- Translation. Right now spanish is available, but more languages would be great.
- Ability to configure bot with commands (default language, default country, stats every N minutes)
